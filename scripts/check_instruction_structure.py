# or a dead extractor, never a target count; a single broken link is its own
# finding regardless of the floor. The two small files (README.md: the logo,
# LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, SUPPORTED-DRIVERS.md, docs/development.md;
# CHANGELOG.md: the logo and the component READMEs) sit one link below today's
# count so one deliberate removal is not misdiagnosed as a regression. The
# driver matrix's floor is deliberately far below its count: its links are one
# per validated model, rows come and go with validation work, and the floor
# only has to catch the file being emptied, so do not raise it row by row.
